    <h2 id="home"> Swarup Sahoo </h2>
    <p  class="para"> I am an engineering manager with 20 years of experience in leading teams to deliver products specializing
        in web applications, containers, orchestration, virtualization, internet and security applications, data plane, control plane and subscriber management. I have
        managed teams at start-ups, such as River Delta Networks and corporations like Motorola.
<br>
<br>
        Currently, I am a senior director of engineering at Benu Networks, a start-up that provides WiFi solutions and
        services to residential and business customers. As a founding member of the team at Benu, I built engineering teams
        from the ground up and also worked with customers to ensure the successful deployment of products.
<br>
<br>
        I led the development of highly scalable and high-performance WiFi Access Gateway, a product deployed by Tier 1 North
        American operator in 60+% of the markets and many other operators with more than 10 million access points and
        7 petabytes of daily throughput.
<br>
<br>
        I have also developed distributed micro-services architecture based solutions that
        scales to support millions of WiFi devices.
<br>
<br>
        Before Benu, I managed an engineering team in Motorola’s Wireless Networks group and shipped many networking products.
        I joined Motorola (currently Arris) through acquisition of RiverDelta Networks (2001), where I held the position of
        Director of Engineering for the company’s cable broadband router. At RiverDelta Networks, I led software development
        and achieved interoperability certification from the University of New Hampshire laboratory and our product achieved
        world-wide acceptance within two years with annual revenue soaring to $300 million.
<br>
<br>
        I have co-authored seven granted and pending patents in the virtualization of CPE functions, WiFi, Internet Protocol,
        and Carrier Grade NAT.
